    "Entropy measures the level of uncertainty associated with a random variable. It essentially tells us how much information we need, on average, to predict the value of that variable. Imagine flipping a coin: there's high uncertainty (two equally probable outcomes), so entropy is high (one bit of information needed).\n",
